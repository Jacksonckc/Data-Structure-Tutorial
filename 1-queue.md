# Queue

## I. Introduction

Waiting in line is a part of everyday life because as a process it has several important functions. Queues are a fair and essential way of dealing with the flow of customers when there are limited resources. Negative outcomes arise if a queue process isnâ€™t established to deal with overcapacity. (Illustrated as lining up for the slide above)

## II. Common Usage of Queue

Queues are commonly used in places where overcapacity occurs. If there is no overcapacity, no queues are needed.

You will see queues are restaurants, postal office, grocery stores, and etc. However, not all the queues are physically present in real life.

Queues are commonly used via internet as well! Since there is no a physical queue line, we have created a queue data structure which helps maintaining order in the virual life.

In the above example, we see that the queue (in this case, virtual waiting room) is being applied to this shopping website. The website capacity can only handle 250 customers at a time, however, there are 1000 customers on the line/purchasing items from the website. This caused a queue to be created according to the order of the customers' entering time.

The important takeaway here is the purpose of the queue. It is not only acting as a waiting place for those 750 customers, but it also organizes the order of the customers to determine who can exist the queue first/who will be the next customer to be served (according to the queue rules and mechanisms).

Let's examine how we can apply these queue rules and mechanisms next.

## III. Common Queue Operation & Efficiency

First, I would like to mention how a queue in Python is initiated.
A queue in Python is defined as a dynamic list:

```python
queue = []
```

I have put together four different operations to apply queue rules and mechanisms, let's take a closer look at them.

### Enqueue:

    The first and foremost operation for a queue to to enter the queue. To do this, we have to first identify the insertion location of
